The Atomic Svelte philosophy is centered around creating a modular, composable UI library that treats components as fundamental building blocks. Here are the core principles:

# ðŸ§± Atomic Architecture

The philosophy is built around the concept of "atoms" - self-contained, reusable UI components that encapsulate their own state and DOM management. Think of it like chemistry: components are the basic elements that can be combined to create more complex molecules (UI patterns).

# Core Structure

Atoms: The smallest composable UI pieces - fundamental building blocks
Bonds: The logic that holds atoms together and enables synchronization between them
Protons, Neutrons, Electrons: Functions that can be attached to atoms to add incremental functionality

# Key Philosophy Points

ðŸ”— Context-Driven Communication: Components communicate through Svelte's context API, enabling powerful parent-child relationships without prop drilling.

- â™¿ Accessibility First: Every component includes proper ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and focus management out of the box.
- ðŸŽ¨ Headless & Stylable: Components are headless by default, giving you complete control over styling while providing sensible defaults.
- âš¡ Reactive by Design: Leverages Svelte's fine-grained reactivity system for optimal performance and smooth user interactions.
- ðŸ”§ Highly Extensible: Easily extend components with custom behaviors, animations, and styling while maintaining core functionality.
- ðŸŽ¯ Type Safety: Fully written in TypeScript with comprehensive type definitions for a robust development experience.

The philosophy treats the library as "raw material" - providing low-level, customizable, scalable UI components that teams can use to build their own custom design systems rather than prescriptive, opinionated components. This approach gives developers maximum flexibility while ensuring consistency and accessibility across their applications.
