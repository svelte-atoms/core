# `shared/capability`

Reusable behavior for Bonds and Atoms.

- **Bond capabilities** coordinate shared state, roles, relationships, and whole-bond setup.
- **Atom capabilities** add local attrs, handlers, lifecycle, or presentation to one runtime Atom.

## Usage Notes

- Register Bond capabilities in the Bond constructor with `bond.capability(...)`, or use
  `bond.registerCapabilities(recipe)` for a bundle/recipe. Both preserve declaration order and use
  last-wins per slot. The root publishes context explicitly with `binding.bond.share()`;
  `bindBond(...)` activates capabilities and destroys the lifecycle owner with the root component.
  Normal roots do not call `useCapabilities()` or `destroy()` themselves.
- Pass Atom capabilities to `createAtomInstance(..., { capabilities })` or register them with
  `atom.capability(...)`. `createAtomInstance` registers the Atom with its Bond before setup, so setup
  can resolve itself through `bond.nodeByPart(...)` or `bond.nodeByRole(...)`.
- Bond and Atom hosts use the same internal runtime. `requires` is strict: missing slots and cycles
  throw before setup. Setup follows stable topological order; setup failure unwinds transactionally.
  Disposal is LIFO, continues after failures, and reports failures as `AggregateError`.
- Prefer `defineCapability(...)` / `defineAtomCapability(...)` over hand-written literals. Their
  metadata records `host: 'bond'` or `host: 'atom'`; a Bond `effect` is whole-bond setup, while Atom
  setup is initialization-local (use behavior `onmount` for an element-mounted lifecycle hook).
- Use `decorateCapability(...)` / `decorateAtomCapability(...)` when replacing behavior you do not
  own. `requiresRoles` remains advisory because atom roles appear lazily during rendering.

The public barrel is [`index.ts`](./index.ts).
