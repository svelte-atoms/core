Declarative helpers for defining Bond families.

| File                 | Purpose                                                                   |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `define.svelte.ts`   | `defineBond(...)`, spec types, generated context keys, and atom metadata. |
| `define-runtime.ts`  | Runtime helpers used by `defineBond`.                                     |
| `use-part.svelte.ts` | Resolves a declared part and owns its standard authoring ceremony.        |
| `fuse.svelte.ts`     | Combines two Bond families into one context surface.                      |
| `index.ts`           | Public barrel for this layer.                                             |

## Usage Notes

- `defineBond<const S extends BondSpec>(spec: S)` has one inference site; use `SpecOf`, `BaseOf`, `StateOf`, `PropsOf`, `PartsOf`, `ExtendsOf`, `AtomsOf`, and `MethodsOf` to inspect it at type level.
- Prefer `BondOf<typeof X>` for defined bond instances.
- Use `parts:` for flat composition and `extends:` only for legacy/spec inheritance.
- Ordinary fixed descendants use `usePart(BondClass, slot, () => restProps, options)` so the helper owns context lookup, registration, role projection, and presentation. Roots, repeated/data-driven, virtual, and runtime-polymorphic parts use `createAtomInstance(...)` directly by explicit exception. Definition metadata remains internal and no public `.spec` is exposed.
- `AtomSpec.part` names a declarative slot only. Atom identity belongs to the Atom constructor and registration belongs to `createAtomInstance({ register })`.
- Definitions record atom metadata for `usePart(...)`; they never manufacture detached Atom methods. Rendered parts use `createAtomInstance(...)` or `usePart(...)` so identity, registration, and teardown stay with the render owner.
- A generic class value loses its type parameter through `typeof` in TypeScript. The DataGrid family and Drawer retain only small static constructor facades to re-introduce that parameter at their public boundary; ordinary bonds expose `defineBond(...)` directly.
