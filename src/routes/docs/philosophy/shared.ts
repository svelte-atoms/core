			title: 'Composition Over Configuration',
			description:
				'Build complex UI by combining simple, focused primitives rather than configuring monolithic components. Each component does one thing well.',
			benefits: [
				'Maximum flexibility in component structure',
				'No artificial limitations on what you can build',
				'Easy to understand component behavior',
				'Predictable composition patterns'
			]
		},

			title: 'Unstyled by Default',
			description:
				'Components provide behavior and accessibility without imposing visual design decisions. You control styling completely.',
			benefits: [
				'Perfect fit for any design system',
				'No fighting against default styles',
				'Use any styling approach (Tailwind, CSS-in-JS, etc.)',
				'Smaller bundle sizes (no unused styles)'
			]
		},
		{
			title: 'Accessibility First',
			description:
				'Proper ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and focus management are built-in, not added as afterthoughts.',
			benefits: [
				'WCAG 2.1 compliant by default',
				'Automatic ARIA attribute management',
				'Full keyboard navigation support',
				'Screen reader optimized'

			'The Bond pattern is our approach to state management and component communication.',

				description:
					'Bonds keep component state isolated. No global stores, no prop drilling. State lives where it's needed.'

					'Bonds can be created inside or outside components. Pass them as props, share them between components, or use them standalone.'
